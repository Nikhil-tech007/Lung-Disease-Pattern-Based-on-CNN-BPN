# Pattern-Based-Detection-using-Deep Learning
This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Backpropagation Networks (BPN), to detect lung diseases from medical images. The model predicts the likelihood of lung disease presence and provides an accuracy score.

## Project Overview
This repository contains:

- **Image Dataset:** A collection of lung images (e.g., X-rays, CT scans) used for training and testing the deep learning models.
- **Python Code:** Scripts implementing the CNN, BPN, image classification, GLCM feature extraction, and model evaluation.
  
## Methodology

**1. Image Preprocessing:**

- Loading and resizing images.
- Normalizing pixel values.
- Data augmentation (optional) to increase dataset variability.
  
**2. Feature Extraction:**

- Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM): Extracting texture features from images using GLCM to capture spatial relationships between pixels.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Utilizing CNN layers (convolutional, pooling, etc.) to automatically learn relevant features from the images.
  
**3. Model Building:**

- BPN: Implementing a Backpropagation Network for classification based on extracted features.
- CNN: Constructing a CNN architecture for end-to-end learning, where the network learns features and performs classification directly from images.
  
**4. Training and Evaluation:**

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training the models using the training data.
- Evaluating model performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch
  
## How to Use
- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Prepare the Dataset: Organize your lung images into appropriate folders (e.g., 'train' and 'test' with subfolders for each disease class).
- Run the Code: Execute the Python scripts to train the models and evaluate their performance.
- Use the Trained Model: Load the saved model to predict lung disease percentage and accuracy on new images.
  
## Results
- Accuracy: Report the achieved accuracy on the test dataset.
- Other Metrics: Include other relevant evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
- Visualization: Consider including visualizations of model performance (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).
